# Assingment_Sorting-algorithms
 :open_book:In this assignment, they are used the three  sorting algorithms: Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, Bucket Sort

## Assignment description :dart::

Following  assignment_Strategy-pattern  you are required to do a comparative analysis where you
need to implement three (3) sorting algorithms:

1. Quick Sort 
2. Bubble Sort 
3. Bucket Sort 

on synthetic data that you produced from assignment 3 for at least forty (40) T-
Shirts with various Colors, Sizes and Fabrics

Using each of the previous algorithms you are required to sort these forty (40) T-
Shirts based on:

1. Size in ascending 
2. Size in descending 
3. Color in ascending 
4. Color in descending 
5. Fabric in ascending 
6. Fabric in descending 
7. Size and Color and Fabric in ascending 
8. Size and Color and Fabric in descending

:black_small_square: Run each the py module Separately

:black_small_square:every py module sorts both in ascending and in descending order :
